Under the hood changes

Website is going to get changed (again) for efficiency and for better clarification.
The thumbnails of the posts are falling behind in terms of efficiency and clarification; I can’t use .webp or .webm containers, since it doesn’t work and the site is based on modified mediumish theme, with not everything available and had to be adjusted by me. You can read more about  .webp and .webm over here:

With the new changes I’m able to support additional video players, like, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitch, Facebook video player and more. Loading the next page is going to be quicker.
And more and better support for a variety of plugins and due changes in the hosting department.

Sincerely,

Guillermo
