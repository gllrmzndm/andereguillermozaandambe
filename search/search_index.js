We\u2019re overusing JS: Both in our dependencies and in our own code. We\u2019re underusing HTML and CSS: This is partly due to IE support, but now that we don\u2019t need to support IE there are many features that become usable.</p> <p>If you can do something using CSS use CSS: There are many things that previously were only achievable using JS that can be done with only CSS nowadays. By doing that you can partly reduce your JS code.</p> <p>Evaluate your toolset: Many newer tools have better performance baselines compared to older ones, and not every project needs to be an SPA. Some of the non-framework-based SSGs like Hugo, Jekyll, or 11ty work great for those use cases.</p> <p>Build for modern browsers: Drop IE support and set your build target to ES 2017 or even 2018. Just doing that might get you bundle size improvements of up to 20%. Consider a11y from the beginning: Having a11y in mind from the planning and design stages is the ideal scenario.

It is what its name describes. It is a package manager for Node based environments. It keeps track of all the packages and their versions and allows the developer to easily update or remove these dependencies. All of these external dependencies are being stored inside a file called called package.json. The initial file can be created easily using CLI npm init (assuming NodeJS is installed in the system). When you install a package using NPM, the packages get downloaded from a dedicated registry. There are lot of features of NPM like publishing. If you like to learn more about NPM, check out the links at the bottom.</p> <p>Every language that we use has some form of package manager, either official or a 3rd party one. PHP has Composer, Python has PIP/Pipenv, Java has Gradle etc.</p> <p>Now, let\u2019s talk briefly about Yarn. It is a package manager that uses NPM registry as its backend. Yarn has two main advantages over NPM. Firstly, Yarn creates a yarn.lock file. This file stores the exact versions of dependencies to the last digit. When installing, Yarn first checks the lock file for the versions, then checks package.json file. NPM has a shrinkwrap command that does exactly this. However, Yarn creates and updates its lock file automatically when dependencies are being installed/updated. Secondly, Yarn is very fast. When installing dependencies for a project, NPM installs packages sequentially. This slows down the performance significantly. Yarn solves this problem by installing these packages in parallel.</p> <p>Webpack is a modular build tool that has two sets of functionality \u2014 Loaders and Plugins. Loaders transform the source code of a module. For example, style-loader adds CSS to DOM using style tags. sass-loader compiles SASS files to CSS. babel-loader transpiles JS code given the presets. Plugins are the core of Webpack. They can do things that loaders can\u2019t. For example, there is a plugin called UglifyJS that minifies and uglifies the output of webpack.</p> <p><code>sudo npm install -g yarn</code></p> <p><code>yarn add --dev webpack @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env node-sass css-loader sass-loader style-loader postcss-loader autoprefixer</code></p>"},{"location":"blog/miscellaneous_web_development.html#webdev-css","title":"Webdev CSS","text":""},{"location":"blog/miscellaneous_web_development.html#css-units","title":"CSS Units","text":"<p>Common Length units</p> <p>But before we start it actually depends on what you want, there's no good or bad. (Read the whole document Guillermo)</p> <p>There are several units used by CSS to express length. The older ones, supported by all browsers, are:</p> <p>rem rem - \u201cr\u201d stands for \u201croot\u201d: \u201croot em\u201d -, which is equal to the font size fixed to the root element almost always `. <p>vh and vw vh and vw - Many responsive web design techniques rely heavily on percentage rules. However, CSS percentage measures are not always the best solution for all problems. The measure vh is equal to 1/100 of the height of the viewport. So, for example, if the height of the browser is 800px, 1vh equals 8px and, similarly, if the width of the viewport is 650px, 1vw is equivalent to 6.5px.</p> <p>vmin and vmax</p> <p>vmin and vmax - These units are related to the maximum or minimum value of vh and vw. For example, if the browser was set to 1200px wide and the height 600px, 1vmin would be 6px and 1vmax would be 12px. However, if the width was set to 700px and the height set to 1080px, vmin would equal 7px and vmax 10.8px.</p> <p>ex and ch</p> <p>ex and ch - These units, similar to em and rem, rely on the current font and font size. However, unlike em and rem, these units also rely on font-family as they are determined based on measures specific to each font. The ch unit (\u201ccharacter unit\u201d) is defined as the width of the character zero (\u201c0\u201d). The ex unit is defined as \u201cthe current x-height of the current font or the half of 1em\u201d. The height-x of a given font is the height of the lowercase \u201cx\u201d of that font. It is often the middle mark of the font.</p>"},{"location":"blog/miscellaneous_web_development.html#css-style-guide","title":"CSS \"Style guide\"","text":"<p>px for borders and box shadows; it's for decoration it's not required for readability.

A caveat for something that has width: 100vw; height: 100vh. The viewport units DON'T take scrollbars into account. So if you do the above and have a vertical scrollbar because of content overflow, you'll also get a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls the exact width of the vertical scrollbar. In this case, often width: 100%; height: 100vh; might work.</p> <p>ch ch is a great unit. Studies have shown in the past that it's easiest for humans to read paragraphs that are between 50-70 letters across in width.
