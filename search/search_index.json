Adding ivrs_ioapic[32]=00:14.0 instead of intremap=off is sufficient to make the system boot until Lenovo releases an UEFI update with a working IVRS table. At least UEFI 1.27 (2018-07-24) needs this override. And spec_store_bypass_disable=prctl is still needed for Ubuntu &amp; co.</p> <p>The clue is the line \"[Firmware Bug]: AMD-Vi: IOAPIC[32] not in IVRS table\". I decompiled the ACPI tables, started to read the AMD documentation, but in the end I just guessed the 32 from the error message and 00:14.0 from the lspci output and the Stack Overflow/Ubuntu forum entries.  Interesting stuff, but too much to read in my little time. </p> <p>What was helpful is the Linux boot parameter amd_iommu_dump=1 which will dump information from the IVRS table:</p> <pre><code>[    0.851042] AMD-Vi: Using IVHD type 0x11\n[    0.851401] AMD-Vi: device: 00:00.2 cap: 0040 seg: 0 flags: b0 info 0000\n[    0.851401] AMD-Vi:        mmio-addr: 00000000feb80000\n[    0.851430] AMD-Vi:   DEV_SELECT_RANGE_START  devid: 00:01.0 flags: 00\n[    0.851431] AMD-Vi:   DEV_RANGE_END           devid: ff:1f.6\n[    0.851870] AMD-Vi:   DEV_ALIAS_RANGE                 devid: ff:00.0 flags: 00   devid_to: 00:14.4\n[    0.851871] AMD-Vi:   DEV_RANGE_END           devid: ff:1f.7\n[    0.851875] AMD-Vi:   DEV_SPECIAL(HPET[0])           devid: 00:14.0\n[    0.851876] AMD-Vi:   DEV_SPECIAL(IOAPIC[33])                devid: 00:14.0\n[    0.851877] AMD-Vi:   DEV_SPECIAL(IOAPIC[34])                devid: 00:00.1\n[    1.171028] AMD-Vi: IOMMU performance counters supported\n</code></pre> <p>Resolving devid 00:14.0 was easy via lspci:</p> <p>00:14.0 SMBus: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

It can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a remote rsync daemon. It offers a large number of options that control every aspect of its behavior and permit very flexible specification of the set of files to be copied. It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between the source files and the existing files in the destination. Rsync is widely used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.</p> <p>Rsync finds files that need to be transferred using a lqquick checkrq algorithm (by default) that looks for files that have changed in size or in last-modified time. Any changes in the other preserved attributes (as requested by options) are made on the destination file directly when the quick check indicates that the file's data does not need to be updated.</p> <p>Some of the additional features of rsync are:</p> <ul> <li>support for copying links, devices, owners, groups, and permissions</li> <li>exclude and exclude-from options similar to GNU tar</li> <li>a CVS exclude mode for ignoring the same files that CVS would ignore</li> <li>can use any transparent remote shell, including ssh or rsh</li> <li>does not require super-user privileges</li> <li>pipelining of file transfers to minimize latency costs</li> <li>support for anonymous or authenticated rsync daemons (ideal for mirroring)</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>Rsync copies files either to or from a remote host, or locally on the current host (it does not support copying files between two remote hosts).

Obviously I'm generalizing here. The difference in work and games is that the rank is getting reset every season (for a most of the games) which doesn't happen in real life, I have seen that. It's a lot easier to get people who are gold or diamond (reasonable good players) than hire someone, because there are multiple factors in real life that don't apply to games. What you get back for gold or diamond players is that consistency which is far more difficult to get in real life, I mean everyone wants the best people for their company, but there are lot of factors to be perceived as being good and yes I said percieved.</p> <p>With most of the games, you see what you get and most of the times a diamond player fit your needs, but things are getting different when you're downranked to silver or bronze. Which means that you need to level up. And that doesn't happen that often in real life, my summary is a good example of beating other people that have more experience. Recruitment in games, is efficient and effective compared to recruiting people for work.</p> <p>I have my own recruitment process for different things in life and most of the times it always begins with a story or kind of an explanation.

If you don\u2019t use your brain you obviously don\u2019t develop it.</p> <p>There are multiple strategies and tactics in real life that you can utilize, this time around I can't be too specific to tell you the strategies and tactics I use in real life, I think one of the easiest one that comes to my mind is grocery shopping, when it's time I have no idea what to get, until I'm in the grocery store itself so:</p> <ul> <li>I don't waste time looking for discounts.</li> <li>I don't get hit with other \"good\" deals, because I'm here for the bare minimum</li> </ul> <p>What I mean with \"bare minimum\" is I can care x amount of grocery with me, getting a six-pack Coke Cola is too much. Of course I can buy a grocery bag, which I'm doing anyway. So back to the grocery store I don't have list, but I've checked fridge before going away and I keep the content into my head, without writing it to a list. Which is better, but not for me, since I'm digital person. So I know what I need, no pressure even when they change the whole store, I think this is the part where experience play a good part of it, since I worked in grovery store myself. Just hit and run is my strategy, be swiftly and go.</p>"},{"location":"blog/Video_games.html#analysis","title":"Analysis","text":"<p>I think Valorant is the easiest way for me to talk about. You died twice on the same spot, you did examine that when looking back at the performance tab in-game, next game you'll try something else or if you can remember the experience you will try different things and basically experiment with it until you get a positive experience. The same thing can be done in real life.</p> <p>Everything described earlier can be learned from video games and can be applied carefully in real life.</p> <p>The best one is obviously riding without Google maps in real life. You learn this in Need For Speed, there's no hand holding getting away from the cops, you have to figure out the route all by yourself and yes I\u2019m able to drive with satellite navigation, the fun thing is\u2026 I drive with satellite navigation on, but not for the guidance but something else and it\u2019s for you to figure out why.</p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>Using satelite navigation in my car or anywhere else give me an extra set of eyes to check. Maybe another street to drive through. Or turning on the guide, but going slightly off, so it recalculates another alternative route.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Opinion: \u201cbut if you cheat or use guides in game, you don't learn anything from games and aren't as challenging as normally. So I did a game called Diablo 3 with whatever the expansion thing was I got invited by someone to play the game and she asked \u201cDon\u2019t use you Icy Veins and I was like flabbergasted that this existed, because I don\u2019t play games with guides and after I got through all those levels it was so boring, so I never touched it again.

Throws her ability to mark enemies and basically spot those enemies in their location on the map. </p> <p>You\u2019re probably looking for a restaurant that makes the best Tagliatelle al Manzo in town. So you decide to use\u2026 a phone and probably Google Maps to gather information.

If you don\u2019t play games or haven\u2019t played in a long time, this theme is from Need For Speed Heat.</p> <p>Video games can help to be better at things in real life, but it takes time, brainpower and skills in order to utilize all the subjects in the real world. This is gaming for me and actually the reason why I did go back to gaming after a few years off. It's a virtal enviroment where you can experiment and leverage the knowledge into the real world without getting \"punished\".</p> <p>I've beaten people that are incredible on paper, but in real life weren't anything ranging from football, snowboarding, basketball and I.T.

There are four key stages related to the Windows 10 upgrade process and a key point is that while an in-place upgrade has been available for a long time it has been avoided in enterprises as very mixed results were found. Huge amounts of work has been done around the in-place upgrade to Windows 10 making it now the preferred option.

It is what its name describes. It is a package manager for Node based environments. It keeps track of all the packages and their versions and allows the developer to easily update or remove these dependencies. All of these external dependencies are being stored inside a file called called package.json. The initial file can be created easily using CLI npm init (assuming NodeJS is installed in the system). When you install a package using NPM, the packages get downloaded from a dedicated registry. There are lot of features of NPM like publishing. If you like to learn more about NPM, check out the links at the bottom.</p> <p>Every language that we use has some form of package manager, either official or a 3rd party one. PHP has Composer, Python has PIP/Pipenv, Java has Gradle etc.</p> <p>Now, let\u2019s talk briefly about Yarn. It is a package manager that uses NPM registry as its backend. Yarn has two main advantages over NPM. Firstly, Yarn creates a yarn.lock file. This file stores the exact versions of dependencies to the last digit. When installing, Yarn first checks the lock file for the versions, then checks package.json file. NPM has a shrinkwrap command that does exactly this. However, Yarn creates and updates its lock file automatically when dependencies are being installed/updated. Secondly, Yarn is very fast. When installing dependencies for a project, NPM installs packages sequentially. This slows down the performance significantly. Yarn solves this problem by installing these packages in parallel.</p> <p>Webpack is a modular build tool that has two sets of functionality \u2014 Loaders and Plugins. Loaders transform the source code of a module. For example, style-loader adds CSS to DOM using style tags. sass-loader compiles SASS files to CSS. babel-loader transpiles JS code given the presets. Plugins are the core of Webpack. They can do things that loaders can\u2019t. For example, there is a plugin called UglifyJS that minifies and uglifies the output of webpack.</p> <p><code>sudo npm install -g yarn</code></p> <p><code>yarn add --dev webpack @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env node-sass css-loader sass-loader style-loader postcss-loader autoprefixer</code></p>"},{"location":"blog/miscellaneous_web_development.html#webdev-css","title":"Webdev CSS","text":""},{"location":"blog/miscellaneous_web_development.html#css-units","title":"CSS Units","text":"<p>Common Length units</p> <p>But before we start it actually depends on what you want, there's no good or bad. (Read the whole document Guillermo)</p> <p>There are several units used by CSS to express length. The older ones, supported by all browsers, are:</p> <p>rem rem - \u201cr\u201d stands for \u201croot\u201d: \u201croot em\u201d -, which is equal to the font size fixed to the root element almost always `. <p>vh and vw vh and vw - Many responsive web design techniques rely heavily on percentage rules. However, CSS percentage measures are not always the best solution for all problems. The measure vh is equal to 1/100 of the height of the viewport. So, for example, if the height of the browser is 800px, 1vh equals 8px and, similarly, if the width of the viewport is 650px, 1vw is equivalent to 6.5px.</p> <p>vmin and vmax</p> <p>vmin and vmax - These units are related to the maximum or minimum value of vh and vw. For example, if the browser was set to 1200px wide and the height 600px, 1vmin would be 6px and 1vmax would be 12px. However, if the width was set to 700px and the height set to 1080px, vmin would equal 7px and vmax 10.8px.</p> <p>ex and ch</p> <p>ex and ch - These units, similar to em and rem, rely on the current font and font size. However, unlike em and rem, these units also rely on font-family as they are determined based on measures specific to each font. The ch unit (\u201ccharacter unit\u201d) is defined as the width of the character zero (\u201c0\u201d). The ex unit is defined as \u201cthe current x-height of the current font or the half of 1em\u201d. The height-x of a given font is the height of the lowercase \u201cx\u201d of that font. It is often the middle mark of the font.</p>"},{"location":"blog/miscellaneous_web_development.html#css-style-guide","title":"CSS \"Style guide\"","text":"<p>px for borders and box shadows; it's for decoration it's not required for readability.

A caveat for something that has width: 100vw; height: 100vh. The viewport units DON'T take scrollbars into account. So if you do the above and have a vertical scrollbar because of content overflow, you'll also get a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls the exact width of the vertical scrollbar. In this case, often width: 100%; height: 100vh; might work.</p> <p>ch ch is a great unit. Studies have shown in the past that it's easiest for humans to read paragraphs that are between 50-70 letters across in width.
